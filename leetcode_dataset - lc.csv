8,String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.

Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.

Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.

Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123"" -> 123`, `""0032"" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).

If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

Note:
Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.

Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.

Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.

Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.

Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.

Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.


Example 4:
Input: s = ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation:
Step 1: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""words and 987"" (reading stops immediately because there is a non-digit 'w')
         ^
The parsed integer is 0 because no digits were read.

Since 0 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 0.


Example 5:
Input: s = ""-91283472332""
Output: -2147483648
Explanation:
Step 1: ""-91283472332"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""-91283472332"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
          ^
Step 3: ""-91283472332"" (""91283472332"" is read in)
                     ^
The parsed integer is -91283472332.

Since -91283472332 is less than the lower bound of the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is clamped to -231 = -2147483648.

38,Count and Say,"The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
`countAndSay(1) = ""1""`
`countAndSay(n)` is the way you would ""say"" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you ""say"" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `""3322251""`:
Given a positive integer `n`, return the `nth` term of the count-and-say sequence.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.


Example 1:

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.

Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.

The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.

The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.

// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

87,Scramble String,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
If the length of the string is 1, stop.

If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.

Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.

Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.

""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.

""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at ranom index each of them.

""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.

""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".

""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.

The algorithm stops now and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.

97,Interleaving String,"Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
`s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
`t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
`|n - m| <= 1`
The interleaving is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`
Note: `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbcbcac""
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s1 = """", s2 = """", s3 = """"

98,Validate Binary Search Tree,"Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

99,Recover Binary Search Tree,"You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Follow up: A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
